## Example template for using RawDataProcessing/batchConvertBin2HDF.sh
# 
# Syntax when run from RawDataProcessing is "./batchConvertBin2HDF.sh Params/<cfgFileName>".
#
# Requires the same parameters expected by Bin2HDF.c cfg file,
# except you give it a list of timestamps and integration times at the end.
# 
# These lists are then parsed by the .sh script and run through a for loop,
# where Bin2HDF is called for each pair of ts and integration time.
# 
# To run properly, fields need to be in exact order as below,
# and all comments need to be removed.
# 
# Also need to run as root to avoid permission problems when making the h5 file.
