# The MKID Pipeline
Data reduction pipeline for Mazinlab MKID instruments.

## Installation
```shell
# Once your shell and conda + mamba are configured create ~/.condarc with these contents
#=============
channels:
  - conda-forge

#Then do 
mkdir ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/mazinlab/mkidpipeline.git
cd mkidpipeline
git checkout <a branch, probably develop or master>
cd ~
#if the following command gives issues try running: conda clean -a
mamba env create --name pipeline -f src/mkidpipeline/condaenv.yml
conda activate pipeline
pip install -e git+https://github.com/mazinlab/mkidcore.git@<whatever branch goes with mkidp>#egg=mkidcore
pip install -e src/mkidpipeline

## Pipeline Quick Start Guide

Move to a directory you would like to play around in, activate your `pipeline` envronment and run: 

`mkidpipe --init`

This will create three YAML config files (NB "_default" will be apended if the file already exists):
1. pipe.yaml - The pipeline global configuration file.
1. data.yaml - A sample dataset. You'll need to redefine this with your actual data.
1. out.yaml - A sample output configuration. You'll need to redefine this as well.

Each of these files contains extensive comments and irrelevant settings (or those for which the defaults are fine) may 
be omitted. More details for pipe.yaml are in mkidpipeline.pipeline and mkidpipeline.steps.<stepname>. More details for 
the other two are in mkidpipeline.config. Data and output yaml files can be vetted with helpful errors by running

`mkidpipe --vet` in the directory containing your three files. 

To build and reduce this dataset open pipe.yaml and make sure you are happy with the default paths, these are sensible if you are working on GLADoS. On dark you'll want to change the `darkdata` folder to `data`. If the various output paths don't exist they will be created, though permissions issues could cause unexpected results. Using a shared database location might save you some time and is strongly encouraged at least across all of your pipeline runs (consider collaborating even with other users)! Outputs will be placed into a generated directory structure under `out` and WILL clobber existing files with the same name.

To generate all necessary directories as specified in the pipe.yaml, run

`mkidpipe --make-dir`

To run the full calibration pipeline and generate specified outputs, use 

`mkidpipe --make-outputs` in the directory containing the three yaml files.

See `mkidpipe --help` for more options, including how to run a single step or specify yaml files in different directories.

After a while (~TODO hours with the defaults) you should have some outputs to look at. To really get going you'll now need to use observing logs to figure out what your data.yaml and out.yaml should contain you want to work with. Look for good seeing conditions and note the times of the nearest laser cals.

## Pipeline flow

When run the pipeline goes through several steps, some only as needed, and only as needed for the requeted outputs, so it won't slow you down to have all your data defined in one place. 

1. Photontables (`mkidpipeline.photontable.Photontable`) files _for the defined outputs_ are created as needed by `mkidpipeline.steps.buildhdf`.
1. Observing metadata defined in the data definition and observing logs is attached to tables by `mkidpipeline.pipeline.batch_apply_metadata`.
1. Any wavecals not already in the database are generated by `mkidpipeline.steps.wavecal.fetch`. There is some intelligence here so if the global config for the step or the start/stop times of the data  the solution will be regnerated. 
1. Photon data is wavelength calibrated by `mkidpipeline.steps.wavecal.apply`.
1. Individual observations (not timeranges) have a bad pixel mask determined and associated by 
   `mkidpipeline.steps.pixcal.apply`.
1. A non-linearity correction is computed and applied `mkidpipeline.steps.lincal.apply`. Note that the maximum correction is <<1% for MECs maximum count rate and this step takes > 1 hour. It is recommended to omit this step.
1. Cosmic-ray events are detected and attached via `mkidpipeline.steps.cosmiccal.apply`
1. Any flatcals not already in the database are generated by `mkidpipeline.steps.flatcal.fetch`. There is some intelligence here so if the global config for the step or the start/stop times of the data  the solution will be regnerated. 
1. Pixels are flat-fielded calibrated `mkidpipeline.steps.flatcal.apply`.
1. Any WCS solutions are generated via `mkidpipeline.steps.wcscal.fetch`, though at present this is a no-op as that code has not been written. All WCS solutions much thus be defined using the wcscal outputs of platescale and so forth (see the example).
1. Requested output products (dithers, stacks, movies, fits cubes, etc) are generated and stored in subdirectories per the output name (`mkidpipeline.steps.output.generate`). 
1. Finally spectral calibration data is generated and saved (speccals often use the output fits files of dithers) and are saved to the database (`mkidpipeline.steps.speccal.fetch`).

### Flat Fielding
Flat fields are based on either whitelight (e.g. a classical quartz/dome/sky flat) observations or on a set of laser observations used for a wavecal. The whitelight codepath is operational but has not seen appreciable use as MEC flats are generally laser-based.


### Running from a shell
Generally shell operation would consist of something to the effect of

```python
import mkidpipeline.definitions as definitions
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import astropy
from astropy.io import fits
import pkg_resources as pkg
import mkidpipeline.config as config
import mkidpipeline.pipeline as pipe
import mkidcore as core
import mkidpipeline.photontable as pt
from mkidcore.corelog import getLogger

lcfg = pkg.resource_filename('mkidpipeline', './utils/logging.yaml')
getLogger('mkidcore', setup=True, logfile=f'mylog.log', configfile=lcfg).setLevel('WARNING')
getLogger('mkidpipeline').setLevel('WARNING')

config.configure_pipeline('pipe.yaml')
o = definitions.MKIDOutputCollection('out.yaml', datafile='data.yaml')
print(o.validation_summary())

# ... then playing around

```
