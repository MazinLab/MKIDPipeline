data: !configdict
  exp_time: .1  # <float | int>. Exposure time (same as exp_timestep in the drizzler block of pipe.yml that was
                # used to make the temporal drizzle)
  smooth: True  # < True | False >. If true, attempts to remove any 'spikes' in counts from the duration of the temporal drizzle
  square_size:  # < int | None > . Size of the square around the central star in pixels. If none, doesn't change the frame size at all
  startt: 0  # < float | None >. Time within the drizzle to start the animation at. If None, defaults to 0
  stopt:  # < float | None >. Time to stop the drizzle animation.
  duration:  # <float | None >. Duration of the desired animation.
  # Duration and stopt can both be specified, in which case duration supersedes stopt. If only one is specified, that is used.
  wvl_bin:  # < int | None >. The index of the wavelength bin desired (if the FITS file has nwvlbins > 1.) If None, uses all wavelengths

  stretch: linear  # linear | asinh | log | power | powerdist | sinh | sqrt | squared

  type: temporal  # temporal | spectral
  fps: 10  # frames per second
  show_title: True  # Display the title at the top of the animation
  plot_data: True  # Plot the data from the drizzled FITS file.
  plot_stack: True  # Plot the stacked frames from the drizzled FITS file successively on top of one another
                    # If plot_data and plot_stack are both true, it will plot them side-by-side which each other.
