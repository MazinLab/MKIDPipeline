Cosmic Cleaner is a class that will find the cosmic correction and will create a file that
has the associated ObsFile name (beginning timestamp) as well as a list of the timestamps
to be removed plus some metadata, such as the cutout times before and after the cosmic ray
event, the method used for peak finding (more on that in the code itself), a set of data for
creating a histogram of bincounts, and more as needed. This docstring will be edited as code
is updated and refined.
